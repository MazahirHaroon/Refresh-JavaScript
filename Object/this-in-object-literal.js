For this, what matter is how it called and not defined. 
Here the this was called inside the function and not a method, 
so this will be either "undefined" in strict mode or
- Browser: window
- Node: Global

/* How to Fix It?
Instead of assigning this directly, use a method (ref() instead of ref: this) 
so this is evaluated at call-time.

/*
Key Takeaways
- Functions don't "capture" this at definition time â€“ this is determined when the function is called.
- If this is used inside a regular function, it defaults to undefined (strict mode) or window (non-strict mode).
